# 🎙️ _"Hey, this is your **Broother** speaking:"_
Here's a quick overview of our organisation, **Broothers Inc!**
<br>

## 🤩 _"yo"_

Welcome to this place, where you'll find a bunch of cool things we made!

## 🌟 _"bro, who are you guys"_
We are **Vivaan** and **Nicholas**, people who know a good chunk of programming and tech, even though we're still in school <br>
We like to make a load of things, including our current ongoing organisation project (it's not public yet!)

## 🔥 _"what do y'all do???"_

- Using different tools and tech to create cool things
- Making web apps, games, or making a game in a web app
- Creating tools that make fun things easier to do

## 🛠 _"guys... what do you even use??"_
- Python 🐍  
- JavaScript⚡
- HTML 🔨
- CSS 💎
- Raspberry Pi 🍓
- Arduino 🤖 (Learning because we're still relatively a noob)
- Whatever else is cool 🙂

## 🌍 _"... can I help out?!"_  
Follow our creations, but to be honest, help us learn more about things that we aren't aware of by:

- Issues
- Discussions
- Pull requests
- Other things that I can't think of right now

## 😋 _" lets be broothers guys ;)"_

📬 **Want to reach out?** Try doing one of the things above (recommended) or email us (We don't think we'll see it that often though...)
